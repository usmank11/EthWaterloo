As university students, one of our biggest struggles is finding reliable, clean, and well-managed rental apartments for the semester. Currently, our only platform to gain insight into rentals before signing a lease is through Reddit, which can often be unreliable, biased, or lacking information on a particular building. Our idea was to create an application that allows Waterloo and Laurier students to leave their reviews on various rentals near the university, enabling students to make informed decisions.
